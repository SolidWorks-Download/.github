## What is SolidWorks Borderless?

**SolidWorks Borderless** is a specialized utility designed to run SolidWorks in **borderless windowed mode**, enhancing the user experience by allowing seamless multitasking and smooth transitions between applications. Unlike traditional fullscreen modes, which can cause delays and interruptions when switching windows, borderless mode ensures that SolidWorks remains stable and responsive, even when alt-tabbing to other tools or references.

This software is particularly beneficial for engineers, designers, and CAD professionals who frequently use multiple monitors or need to access other applications while working in SolidWorks. By eliminating borders and maximizing screen real estate, SolidWorks Borderless provides a more fluid and integrated workflow.

Key advantages include:
- Improved alt-tab performance without minimizing the application.
- Better support for multi-monitor setups.
- Enhanced stability when running alongside other design or simulation tools.
- Ideal for presentations, tutorials, and collaborative work.

SolidWorks Borderless is open-source, completely free, and compatible with Windows 10 and Windows 11. It is trusted by professionals worldwide for its reliability and ease of use.
